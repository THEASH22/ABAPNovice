# ABAP Learning Journey - Consulting Internship
Hello World! This repository showcases my ABAP code development during my first SAP consulting internship. It reflects my learning progression and includes practice exercises, project-based code examples (e.g., ALV reports, Core Data Services (CDS)), and solutions to various problems I encountered.
<br>
<br>
I'm a novice in SAP (_currently at the time of writing_) and started learning ABAP programming during my 12-week internship as part of the technical team. This repository documents the assignments I completed to solidify my understanding of the language.
<br>
<br>
I hope you find it helpful if you are venturing into SAP ABAP programming, especially those new to the language.

<br>
_Contents:_
<br>
<br>
Task 1: Basic ALV Report (Z_ALV_PRACTICE_EKKO) <br>
Description: Create a basic ABAP report to extract data from the EKKO table and display it in an ALV grid.
<br>
<br>
Task 2: Joining Tables and ALV (Z_ALV_PRACTICE_EKKO_EKPO) <br>
Description: Enhance the previous report to include data from both EKKO and EKPO tables. Join the tables based on relevant fields and display the combined data in an ALV grid.
<br>
<br>
Task 3: ALV Report with Selection Screen (Z_ALV_PRACTICE_EKKO_EKPO_SS) <br>
Description: Implement a selection screen on the report to allow users to filter the displayed data based on specific criteria. Use the selected parameters to refine the data extraction from EKKO and EKPO tables.
<br>
<br>
Task 4: CDS View and OData Service (Z_CDS_EKKO_EKPO) <br>
Description: Create a Core Data Services (CDS) view to encapsulate the logic for joining EKKO and EKPO tables. Expose this CDS view as an OData service to enable data consumption through Fiori applications.

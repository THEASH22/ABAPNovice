# ABAP Learning Journey - Consulting Internship
Hello World! This repository showcases my ABAP code development during my first SAP consulting internship. It reflects my learning progression and includes practice exercises, project-based code examples (e.g., ALV reports, Core Data Services (CDS)), and solutions to various problems I encountered.
<br>
<br>
I'm a novice in SAP (_currently at the time of writing_) and started learning ABAP programming during my 12-week internship as part of the technical team. This repository documents the assignments I completed to solidify my understanding of the language.
<br>
<br>
I hope you find it helpful if you are venturing into SAP ABAP programming, especially those new to the language.
